# Automatic classification of skin lesion

Classification of skin lesion images by a machine learning approach.

The goal of this project is to classify images of skin lesion into two classes: malignant tumour (label 0) or benign (label 1) tumour. The images in question in this project are as follows:

</p>

For this purpose wa have applied classification algorithm on a data set where each sample is composed from 3 types of image:
  - Original image: the RGB image of the tumor. 
  - The segmented image: Binary image 
  - Superpixel image
